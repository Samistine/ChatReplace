ChatReplace - modify chat messages using regular expressions.
====================================

ChatReplace is plugin for the Minecraft wrapper [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) that provides a method for administrators to reactively modify chat on a server through matching regular expressions. You could use this to match undesirble words and change them into less offensive ones or censor them completely. Alternatively you could use the plugin to create simple roleplay themed events or enforce a particular style of language on a server.

## Features

- Simple and easy to configure.
- Match messages using powerful regular expressions.
- Randomly chooses a replacement for each match from the list attached to each pattern.

## Installation

### Ensure you are using the latest recommended build.

Before installing, you need to make sure you are running at least the latest [recommended build](http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/Recommended/) for Bukkit. Support is only given for problems when using a recommended build. This does not mean that the plugin will not work on other versions of Bukkit, the likelihood is it will, but it is not supported.

### Getting ChatReplace

The best way to install ChatReplace is to use the [static link](http://downloads.james.richardson.name/public/binaries/chatreplace/ChatReplace.jar) to the latest version. This link always points to the latest version of ChatReplace, so is safe to use in scripts or update plugins.
    
Alternatively [older versions](http://downloads.james.richardson.name/public/binaries/chatreplace/) are available as well, however they are not supported. If you are forced to use an older version for whatever reason, please let me know why by [opening a issue](https://github.com/grandwazir/ChatReplace/issues/new) on GitHub.

## Configuration

1. Configure your settings (config.yml) and [choose what type](https://github.com/grandwazir/ChatReplace/wiki/instructions) of replacement you want to do.
2. [Add patterns](https://github.com/grandwazir/ChatReplace/wiki/instructions) that you want match to the respective configuration file.
3. [Configure permissions](https://github.com/grandwazir/ChatReplace/wiki/permissions) if necessary.
