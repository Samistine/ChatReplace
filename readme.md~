TimedMessages - broadcast messages at specific times.
====================================

TimedMessage is plugin for the Minecraft wrapper [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) that provides a method for administrators to broadcast messages perodically to the players on their server. You could use these messages to broadcast hints or important news. Alternativly you could target them at specific players who have a specific permission node, for example giving new player tips for guests on your server.

## Features

- Simple and easy to configure.
- Broadcast a message from a predefined list perodically.
- Messages support colour codes in either classic format or in the style of &RED.
- Split long messages into multiple lines with `.
- Optionally define a permission node a player must have to receive that message.
- Define times using flexible human readable format: i.e 1h30m = 1 hour and 30 minutes.
- Start, stop, reload and check the status of your messages in game.

## Installation

### Ensure you are using the latest recommended build.

Before installing, you need to make sure you are running at least the latest [recommended build](http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/Recommended/) for Bukkit. Support is only given for problems when using a recommended build. This does not mean that the plugin will not work on other versions of Bukkit, the likelyhood is it will, but it is not supported.

### Getting TimedMessages

The best way to install TimedMessages is to use the [static link](http://downloads.james.richardson.name/public/binaries/timedmessages/TimedMessages.jar) to the latest version. This link always points to the latest version of TimedMessages, so is safe to use in scripts or update plugins.
    
Alternatively [older versions](http://downloads.james.richardson.name/public/binaries/timedmessages/) are available as well, however they are not supported. If you are forced to use an older version for whatever reason, please let me know why by [opening a issue](https://github.com/grandwazir/TimedMessages/issues/new) on GitHub.

## Configuration

1. Configure your settings (config.yml) and [add messages](https://github.com/grandwazir/TimedMessages/wiki/instructions) to messages.yml.
2. [Add permissions](https://github.com/grandwazir/TimedMessages/wiki/permissions) if necessary.
